## Description

<br>

This project is my first iteration of my portfolio. It both acts as a long-term development of my portfolio and as practice for advanced CSS techniques. It contains the core elements of a portfolio: my name, a navigation area, a picture of me, a summary, a list of projects, and my contact information. For now, only one project is linked since I have only done one project. Eventually, I will build up my portfolio with more projects I am proud of and enhance it with new techniques as I learn.

The most significant, and also most difficult elements I worked with to build my portfolio was flex boxes. Flex boxes are capable of formatting in magical ways, but they can be equally as stubborn. My skills started out weak, but as I worked more on this project, I gradually grew more competent with the use of flex boxes.
